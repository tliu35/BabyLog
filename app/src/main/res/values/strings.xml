        "Developmental milestones at 1 month\n\n"
        "The first days with your 1-month-old can be a blur of feeding, changing diapers, settling"
        "her to sleep, and responding to her wails. But within a few weeks, she'll start to take"
        "more notice of your voice, face, and touch.\n\n"

        "Your baby can't focus farther than 8 to 12 inches away – just the right distance for her"
        "to gaze at your face. Black-and-white patterns also draw her attention. Her hearing is "
        "fully developed and she might turn toward familiar sounds, such as your voice.\n\n"

        "She can lift her head briefly and turn it to the side when she's on her stomach, but when"
        "she's upright her head and neck still need support. Although her arms move jerkily, she"
        "can get her hands close to her mouth.\n\n"

        "Your role\n\n"

        "Enjoy getting to know your baby: Cuddle her, talk to her, and learn how she signals when"
        "she's sleepy or hungry. Be attentive and responsive. You can't spoil a baby!\n\n"

        "Give her plenty of tummy time from the start when she's awake so she can strengthen her "
        "muscles. Encourage her to look at and reach for toys.\n\n"

        "Make sure she gets plenty of time outside. Go for walks with her and take her to the park"
        "or playground. She'll enjoy the outdoors, relaxing with you, and being around other "
        "children.\n\n"

        "Get close and make eye contact with your baby when you talk, sing, and read to her.\n\n"

        "Play simple games when she's alert and in the mood, such as peekaboo or mimicking her "
        "sounds.\n\n"
        " Learn the signs that she's had enough play and needs some down time.\n\n\n\n\n"
    </string>

    <string name="month3">
        "Developmental milestones at 3 months \n\n"
        "By now, you're basking in the warmth of your baby's delighted smiles! Your 3-month old "
        "actively enjoys playtime now, amusing you both when he imitates your facial expressions. "
        "He's starting to babble and mimic the sounds you make.\n\n"

        "You no longer need to support his head. When he's on his stomach, he can lift his head and"
        "chest, and even do the mini-pushups that set the stage for rolling over. He can open and "
        "close his hands, shake toys, swat at dangling objects, bring his hands to his mouth, and "
        "push down with his legs if you hold him in a standing position.\n\n"

        "His hand-eye coordination is improving. You'll notice him closely tracking objects that "
        "interest him and focusing intently on faces. He's able to recognize you from across the "
        "room!\n\n"

        "Your role\n\n"

        "Don't worry about spoiling your baby: Responding to him promptly helps him feel secure and"
        "loved. You can help him learn to soothe himself by guiding his thumb to his mouth or "
        "offering him a pacifier.\n\n"
        "Continue to make tummy time part of his daily routine so he can practice his new skills "
        "and strengthen his muscles. When he's on his tummy, give him toys and safe objects he can "
        "reach for, hold, and explore.\n\n"
        "Give your baby lots of loving attention. Talk to him throughout the day, describing what "
        "you're doing and naming familiar objects. Read books together. Share cuddles, play games,"
        "and encourage his efforts to roll over, grab toys, and \"talk\" with you.\n\n\n\n\n"
    </string>

    <string name="month47">
        "Developmental milestones at 4 to 7 months\n\n"
        "Your baby is fully engaged with the world now: She smiles, laughs, and has babbling "
        "\"conversations\" with you. And she's on the move – by 7 months she can probably roll to "
        "her tummy and back again, sit without your help, and support her weight with her legs well"
        "enough to bounce when you hold her. She uses a raking grasp to pull objects closer and can"
        "hold toys and move them from one hand to another.\n\n"

        "Your baby is more sensitive to your tone of voice and may heed your warning when you tell"
        "her \"no.\" She also knows her name now and turns to look at you when you call her.\n\n"

        "Peekaboo is a favorite game and she enjoys finding partially hidden objects. She views the"
        "world in full color now and can see farther. If you move a toy in front of her, she'll "
        "follow it closely with her eyes. Watching herself in a mirror is sure to delight her.\n\n"

        "Your role\n\n"

        "Your baby thrives on the interactions she has with you, so integrate play into everything"
        "you do with her. Shower her with smiles and cuddles, and reply when she babbles to encou-"
        "rage her communication skills. Read together every day, naming the objects you see in "
        "books and around you.\n\n"

        "Give her lots of opportunities to strengthen her new physical skills by helping her sit "
        "and positioning her to play on both her stomach and back. Before she can crawl, be sure to"
        "childproof your home and keep her environment safe for exploring."

        "Provide a variety of age-appropriate toys and household objects (like wooden spoons or "
        "cartons) to explore. Work on establishing a routine for sleeping, feeding, and playtime.\n\n"

        "By 6 months, she may be ready to start solid food.\n\n\n\n\n"

    <string name="month812">
        "Developmental milestones at 8 to 12 months\n\n"
        "Look at your baby go! He's become an eager explorer, and it might surprise you how quickly"
        "he can get around when he crawls or scoots. He can sit on his own now and grabs anything "
        "he can to pull himself up to standing and "cruise." He might even take some solo steps "
        "before his first birthday.\n\n"

        "His babbling sounds more like real conversation, and you'll hear his first words – often"
        "\"mama\" or \"dada.\" Soon he'll talk in simple phrases, but in the meantime he uses "
        "gestures to indicate what he wants – or doesn't want! – and pays close attention to your "
        "words.\n\n"

        "His hands are increasingly nimble: He amuses himself putting things in containers and "
        "taking them out again. He can use his thumb and finger in a pincer grasp to eat finger "
        "food. Your baby loves to be just like you by combing his own hair, drinking from a cup, "
        "and pretending to talk on the phone.\n\n"

        "While he may seem outgoing, he's probably reserved around strangers. And when you leave "
        "him, he may become distraught – separation anxiety is normal at this age.\n\n\n"

        "Your role\n\n"

        "Keep talking to your baby: This is a critical time for his language development. Describe"
        "your routine, what you're doing now and what you're going to do next, and what you see. "
        "Describing how you think your baby is feeling helps him learn emotions. Keep reading "
        "together and play peekaboo, hide-and-seek, and turn-taking games.\n\n"

        "As he gets more active, it's important to provide a safe space to explore. He may not be"
        "walking quite yet, but you can help him get ready by holding him in a way that puts weight"
        "on his legs or by propping him up against the sofa.\n\n"

        "Pay attention to what he enjoys, and give him the freedom to use all his senses to play "
        "and discover. Offer him crayons and paper, stacking blocks, empty food containers, and pots"
        "and pans to play with.\n\n"

        "Praise and reward good behavior. If he gets into mischief, a brief \"no\" and redirection"
        "is usually enough. Although he's too young to understand and obey rules, you can start "
        "showing him which behaviors aren't allowed and helping him find more appropriate "
        "activities.\n\n"

        "Be respectful of his separation anxiety: Build trust by giving him time to get used to new"
        "caregivers and always saying goodbye before you leave.\n\n\n\n\n"
